                <strong>This project analyses biodiversity data across national parks in the USA, with the aim of answering the following questions:</strong>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How many endangered species are present in these national parks?</li>
                        <li>Are certain types of species (mammal, reptile, amphibian etc) more likely to be endangered than others?</li>
                        <li>Is there any significant difference in the probability of one species being endangered relative to another?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                Using Pandas, I load the data, manipulate the datasets and perform some exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the type of data we are working with. After this, I delve deeper into the questions.

            <h3>Exploring the Dataset</h3>
            <p>First, relevant libraries which will be used for the project are imported as follows.</p>
            <pre><code>
                import numpy as np
                import pandas as pd
                from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
                import seaborn as sns
                </code></pre>
